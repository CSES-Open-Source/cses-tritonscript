# Project Guidelines

## 1. Git

### 1.1 Some Git rules

There are a set of rules to keep in mind:

- Perform work in a feature branch.

  _Why:_

  > Because this way all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch. It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code. [read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

- Branch out from `develop`

  _Why:_

  > This way, you can make sure that code in master will almost always build without problems, and can be mostly used directly for releases.

- Never push into `develop` or `main` branch. Make a Pull Request.

  _Why:_

  > It notifies team members that they have completed a feature. It also enables easy peer-review of the code and dedicates forum for discussing the proposed feature.

- Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.

  _Why:_

  > It will clutter up your list of branches with dead branches. It ensures you only ever merge the branch back into (`main` or `develop`) once. Feature branches should only exist while the work is still in progress.

- Before making a Pull Request, make sure your feature branch builds successfully and passes all tests (including code style checks).

  _Why:_

  > You are about to add your code to a stable branch. If your feature-branch tests fail, there is a high chance that your destination branch build will fail too. Additionally, you need to apply code style check before making a Pull Request. It aids readability and reduces the chance of formatting fixes being mingled in with actual changes.

### 1.2 Git workflow

- Sync with remote to get changes youâ€™ve missed.
  ```sh
  git checkout develop
  git pull
  ```
- Checkout a new feature/bug-fix branch.
  ```sh
  git checkout -b <branchname>
  ```
- Make Changes.

  ```sh
  git add <file1> <file2> ...
  git commit
  ```

  _Why:_

  > `git add <file1> <file2> ... ` - you should add only files that make up a small and coherent change.

  > `git commit` will start an editor which lets you separate the subject from the body.

  > Read more about it in _section 1.3_.

  _Tip:_

  > You could use `git add -p` instead, which will give you chance to review all of the introduced changes one by one, and decide whether to include them in the commit or not.

- Make a Pull Request to `develop`.
- Pull request will be accepted, merged and close by a reviewer.
- Remove your local feature branch if you're done.

  ```sh
  git branch -d <branchname>
  ```

  to remove all branches which are no longer on remote

  ```sh
  git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv --no-color | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done
  ```

### 1.3 Writing good commit messages

Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes working with Git and collaborating with others a lot easier. Here are some rules of thumb ([source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)):

- Separate the subject from the body with a newline between the two.

  _Why:_

  > Git is smart enough to distinguish the first line of your commit message as your summary. In fact, if you try git shortlog, instead of git log, you will see a long list of commit messages, consisting of the id of the commit, and the summary only.

- Limit the subject line to 50 characters and Wrap the body at 72 characters.

  _why_

  > Commits should be as fine-grained and focused as possible, it is not the place to be verbose. [read more...](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule-8a906f61f09c)

- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) in the subject line.

  _Why:_

  > Rather than writing messages that say what a committer has done. It's better to consider these messages as the instructions for what is going to be done after the commit is applied on the repository. [read more...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2079612)

- Use the body to explain **what** and **why** as opposed to **how**.

## 2. Documentation

- Keep `README.md` updated as a project evolves.
- Comment your code. Try to make it as clear as possible what you are intending with each major section.
- If there is an open discussion on GitHub or stackoverflow about the code or approach you're using, include the link in your comment.
- Don't use comments as an excuse for a bad code. Keep your code clean.
- Don't use clean code as an excuse to not comment at all.
- Keep comments relevant as your code evolves.

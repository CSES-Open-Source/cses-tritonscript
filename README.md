## Open Source Class Notes Repository Project

#### Repository for the Open Source Project undertaken by the Computer Science and Engineering Society @ UC San Diego.

Welcome to the CSES Open Source Class Notes Repository Project! This repository is a collaborative effort undertaken by the Computer Science and Engineering Society (CSES) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project, how it works, and how you can contribute.

### About the Project

Our goal is to create a platform where every CSES member can actively contribute to building a valuable resource for UCSD students. We aim to develop a community-driven forum for sharing class notes and educational resources. This project encompasses the following key features:

- **Repository of Class Notes:** A central repository where students can share their class notes and resources.
- **Mobile App & Website:** Accessible through both a mobile app and a web platform for seamless usability.
- **UCSD Credentials Login:** Securely log in using your UCSD credentials to ensure the authenticity of contributors.
- **Course Contributions:** Any student can add a class they've taken and contribute by uploading their class notes.
- **Mega-Repository:** A centralized hub with notes for various classes that anyone can contribute to.
- **NLP Integration:** Potential integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert handwritten text to PDFs, verify uploaded documents, and more.

### How it Works

We encourage all CSES members to actively participate in this open-source project. Here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork this Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Branch:** Develop your feature or work on a task in a new branch. Be sure to name it appropriately, reflecting the task you're working on.

3. **Commit & Push:** Make your changes, commit them, and push your branch to your forked repository.

4. **Open a Pull Request:** Once you're ready to contribute, open a pull request from your branch to this main repository. Describe your changes, and our team will review it.

5. **Collaboration:** Engage in discussions within the pull request and make any necessary revisions based on feedback from the community.

6. **Milestone Completion:** Upon successfully merging your pull request, you'll earn points in your CSES membership, and you might qualify for additional rewards such as access to free merchandise, early access to career fairs, gift cards, and more.

### Incentives for Contributions

We believe in recognizing and rewarding our contributors. By actively participating in this project, you can earn:

- **CSES Membership Points:** Accumulate points in your CSES membership, boosting your involvement and recognition within the society.

### About the Project

Our goal is to create a platform where every CSES member can actively contribute to building a valuable resource for UCSD students. We aim to develop a community-driven forum for sharing class notes and educational resources. This project encompasses the following key features:

- **Repository of Class Notes:** A central repository where students can share their class notes and resources.
- **Mobile App & Website:** Accessible through both a mobile app and a web platform for seamless usability.
- **UCSD Credentials Login:** Securely log in using your UCSD credentials to ensure the authenticity of contributors.
- **Course Contributions:** Any student can add a class they've taken and contribute by uploading their class notes.
- **Mega-Repository:** A centralized hub with notes for various classes that anyone can contribute to.
- **NLP Integration:** Potential integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert handwritten text to PDFs, verify uploaded documents, and more.
